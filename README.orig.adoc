An Ansible role for installing checkmk's agent on a Host (Linux and Windows)
by using a standard installation package.

[[meta]]
== üîé Metadata
Below you can find information on‚Ä¶

* the role's required Ansible version
* the role's supported platforms
* the role's https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies[role dependencies]

.link:meta/main.yml[]
[source,yaml]
----
include::meta/main.yml[]
----


[[requirements]]
== üìå Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.


The https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general[`community.general` collection]
must be installed on the Ansible controller.


[[variables]]
== üìú Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.


[source,yaml]
----
checkmk_site_url: ~
----
URL to a CheckMk site that uses the same version as `checkmk_agent_version`.
Must *not* end with an `/`.

#Must be supplied# if `checkmk_agent_url` is not supplied by yourself.

[source,yaml]
----
checkmk_agent_version: "2.0.0p28"
----
#Must be supplied#.

Used to construct `checkmk_agent_url` if it is not defined.

Version of CheckMK RAW edition to install.

[NOTE]
====
The default value of these variables is semi-automatically being updated
to the latest non-beta CheckMk RAW v2 Release through the help of a CI Workflow
and some accompanying python scripts which can be found in `__scripts` of my
https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-checkmk_server[`ansible-role-checkmk_server`].

Every said update is accompanied with a new release of at least a minor version bump.
See <<changelog>> for an overview.
====

[NOTE]
=====
Even though you could pin the version of this role to get a pinned version of checkmk,
I recommend that you install the latest version of this role and
change these variables yourself instead as I do not backport
actual patches made to this role into older versions
(if that is even possible).
=====

[source,yaml]
----
checkmk_agent_url: [OS-specific by default, see /vars directory]
----
URL to the CheckMk installation package.

*Can* be supplied if you want to overwrite it yourself.



[[public_vars]]
== üìú Facts/Variables defined by this role

Each variable listed in this section
is dynamically defined when executing this role (and can only be overwritten using `ansible.builtin.set_facts`) _and_
is meant to be used not just internally.


[[tags]]
== üè∑Ô∏è Tags

// Checkout https://github.com/tribe29/ansible-collection-tribe29.checkmk/blob/main/roles/server/README.md#tags
// for an awesome example of grouping tasks using tags

Tasks are tagged with the following
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html#adding-tags-to-roles[tags]:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Tag | Purpose

2+| This role does not have officially documented tags yet.

// | download-xyz
// |
// | install-prerequisites
// |
// | install
// |
// | create-xyz
// |
|===

You can use Ansible to skip tasks, or only run certain tasks by using these tags. By default, all tasks are run when no tags are specified.

[[dependencies]]
== üë´ Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.



[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users.

[NOTE]
====
This role is part of https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-roles[
many compatible purpose-specific roles of mine].

The machine needs to be prepared.
In CI, this is done in `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`
which sources its soft dependencies from `requirements.yml`:
